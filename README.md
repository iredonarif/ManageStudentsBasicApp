# ManageStudentsBasicApp
Basic student management application with Java Swing library.

I developped this basic app in my second year of computer science when i was learning swing library by my self.
I coded it without using any IDE; only a simple text editor (gedit and sometimes sublime text); so the interfaces are not generated.

To make it simple (without having to connect a database) the data entered are stored in a file.
